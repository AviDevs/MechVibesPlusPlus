### Mechvibes++ Known Issues

Please [join our discord](https://discord.gg/WR5Ax6vXNU) if you have any issues that __are not__ listed here.

## Software issues

- Blank soundpack list
        - Mechvibes++ automatically attempts to **not** load any soundpacks that appear broken. This may not work sometimes. Delete any recently installed soundpacks
- Does not stop loading
        - Install VC Redist, listed on the [main information doc](README.md)
- No mouse sounds visual
        - Enable it in your system tray.
- No audio and UI is not updating after fresh install
        - Quit (system tray) and re-open the app

## System issues

- No audio
        - Check system sound settings & drivers, and make sure there is no conflicting software
- Windows flagged it as a virus
        - Windows Defender will probably block the Mechvibes++ installer. In simple terms, this is because we have not made Microsoft verify the software as safe (hence Unknown publisher)
        - The program is not a virus. Feel free to scroll through the public online code, and/or scan it with your antivirus software of choice. 
        - To stop it from being blocked, click on “more info” and then “Run anyway” 
- High RAM Usage
        - If regular Mechvibes is open: Quit it from system tray
        - Otherwise: Solution is being made
